Explanation:

1. **Title Modification:**
   - The title of the document is changed to "Bootstrap Background Color Examples."

2. **Bootstrap CSS:**
   - The `<link>` tag is included to link the Bootstrap CSS file (`bootstrap.css`).

3. **Comments:**
   - Comments are added to the code for better understanding of each section, Bootstrap classes used, and their purposes.

Note: Make sure to replace `text-bg-dark` with an actual Bootstrap background color class. Bootstrap doesn't have a class named `.bg-body` as it is automatically applied to the body element.
